This is repo was created to try determine how long the account changes script was going to take to run.

How To
------
  1. Enter in how many users have been successfully processed
  2. Using the current time it will determine how long it will take the script to finish

To Do
-----
There's really nothing to do, this is a throw-away script I was just playing with. The account changes script is being replaced anyways. But in theory...
  1. The script is asking for user input, it should just get the data directly from the account changes script or at least its logs itself.
  2. Script is designed for only tracking a single account change run, need to be able to track multiple runs
  3. Remove hardcoding of start time and total users
  4. Do intelligent calculations based on historical and recent data
  5. Least Squares Approximation
  6. Create a UI and graph data
